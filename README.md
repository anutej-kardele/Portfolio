# 👨‍💻 Portfolio

### 🔴 **Live Demo:** <a href="https://anutej.us" target="_blank">anutej.us</a> 

> A personal portfolio website built with **React + Vite**, designed to mimic the developer experience of Visual Studio Code.

## 📖 About The Project

This isn't just a static resume—it's an interactive experience hosted live at **[anutej.us](https://anutej.us)**.

I built this portfolio to reflect the environment where developers spend most of their time: the IDE. 

The application features a fully functional "Editor" interface, a file explorer for navigation, and a **custom-built AI Chatbot** powered by Google Gemini that can answer questions about my skills, experience, and background in real-time.

### ✨ Key Features

* **VS Code Aesthetic**: A pixel-perfect recreation of the VS Code UI, including the sidebar, tabs, and status bar.
* **🤖 Integrated AI Assistant**: A built-in chat interface powered by **Google Gemini (GenAI SDK)**. It acts as a virtual assistant to answer questions about my resume.
* **🌗 Dynamic Theming**: Fully supported **Light & Dark modes** that instantly switch the entire IDE color palette (editor, sidebar, terminal).
* **Interactive Terminal**: A custom loading screen and status updates that mimic a terminal build process.
* **React + Vite**: Blazing fast performance and hot module replacement.
